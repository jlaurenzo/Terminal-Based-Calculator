Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is my first personal project as a Computer Science student. While it may seem clichÃ©, I chose to create a terminal-based calculator to apply what Iâ€™ve learned from my subjects â€” Computer Programming I and Introduction to Computing.

Beyond basic arithmetic and multiplicative operations, this calculator also integrates concepts from my math courses such as Number Theory, Linear Algebra, and MMW (Mathematics in the Modern World). Through this project, I aim to combine programming logic with mathematical problem-solving by implementing both fundamental and advanced algorithms.
