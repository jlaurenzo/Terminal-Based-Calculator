# Dev Note

Hey there! 👋  

This is my **first ever personal project** as a Computer Science student. I decided to build a **terminal-based calculator**, a simple yet a huge leap for me to put into practice what I’ve learned in *Computer Programming I* and *Introduction to Computing*.  

I also wanted to mix in some of the math concepts from my other courses like **Number Theory**, **Linear Algebra**, and **Mathematics in the Modern World**. This project is my way of sharpening my algorithm making skill and connecting coding logic with real mathematical problem-solving.
